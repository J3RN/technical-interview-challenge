# Vetspire Take Home Project

## Prerequisites

I am using the following language versions:
- Elixir v1.15.7
- Erlang/OTP v26.1.2
- Node.js v20.10.0 (LTS)

If you are using ASDF and have the requisite plugins installed, you can install these versions by `cd`ing into wherever you've cloned this project and running `asdf install`.

## Running the Application

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/index.html`](http://localhost:4000/index.html) from your browser.
